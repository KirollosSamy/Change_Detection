RANSAC, which stands for Random Sample Consensus, is a robust algorithm used for estimating the parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data that contains outliers. Hereâ€™s an explanation tailored for someone unfamiliar with the concept:

Key Concepts
Model Estimation: Suppose you want to fit a model to your data. In image processing, this model could be a transformation that aligns two images.
Outliers: These are data points that don't fit the model well. In the context of image alignment, these could be incorrectly matched feature points.
Consensus: Finding a model that fits the largest subset of your data points (inliers).
How RANSAC Works
Random Sampling:

RANSAC starts by randomly selecting a small subset of the data points to fit the model.
For image alignment, this means picking a few matched feature points from the reference and slave images.
Model Fitting:

Using the randomly chosen points, a model is fitted. For image alignment, this could be a transformation (like a projective transform).
Consensus Set:

The fitted model is then used to predict where other points should be.
All the data points are tested against this model to see how well they fit (i.e., how close they are to the model prediction within a certain threshold).
Points that fit well are considered inliers, while those that don't are outliers.
Evaluate and Iterate:

The number of inliers (points that fit the model) is counted.
This process (steps 1-3) is repeated many times, each time with a different random subset of points.
The model with the highest number of inliers is considered the best.
Refine the Model:

Once the best model is found, it can be refined by re-fitting it using all inliers.
